# Technology Stack Rationale

## Overview

This document explains the reasoning behind the technology choices for the Couple Face-Swap project.

## Backend Stack

### Python 3.10+

**Why:**
- Best ecosystem for AI/ML libraries (InsightFace, ONNX, OpenCV)
- Excellent async support for concurrent processing
- Strong typing with type hints
- Mature tooling and testing frameworks

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Node.js: Weaker ML/AI ecosystem
- Go: Limited ML library support
- Java: More verbose, heavier runtime

### FastAPI

**Why:**
- High performance (comparable to Node.js/Go)
- Automatic API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
- Built-in async/await support
- Excellent type validation with Pydantic
- Modern Python framework with active development

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Flask: Synchronous by default, less modern
- Django: Too heavyweight for API-only service
- Express (Node.js): Less suitable for ML workloads

### PostgreSQL

**Why:**
- Robust ACID compliance
- Excellent JSONB support for flexible metadata
- Strong array support for tags
- Mature, production-proven
- Great performance for structured data

**Alternatives Considered:**
- MongoDB: Less suitable for relational data
- MySQL: Weaker JSON support
- SQLite: Not suitable for production

### Celery + Redis

**Why:**
- Industry-standard for Python background tasks
- Redis provides both task queue and result backend
- Excellent monitoring and debugging tools (Flower)
- Scalable to multiple workers
- Good failure recovery mechanisms

**Alternatives Considered:**
- RQ (Redis Queue): Less feature-rich
- Kafka: Overkill for this use case
- Direct threading: Not scalable

## Face-Swap Algorithm

### InsightFace + inswapper

**Why:**
- Production-ready, high-quality results
- Fast inference (< 5s with GPU)
- Active development and community
- ONNX format for portability
- Good documentation

**Key Advantages:**
1. **Speed:** Real-time capable with GPU
2. **Quality:** State-of-the-art face detection and swapping
3. **Simplicity:** Easy to integrate and use
4. **Portability:** ONNX models work across platforms

**Alternatives Considered:**

1. **SimSwap**
   - Pros: High quality, good for videos
   - Cons: More complex setup, slower
   - Verdict: Keep as backup option

2. **DeepFaceLab**
   - Pros: Comprehensive, highest quality
   - Cons: Very heavy, complex, slow
   - Verdict: Too complex for MVP

3. **FaceSwap (original)**
   - Pros: Open source, full control
   - Cons: Requires training, complex
   - Verdict: Not suitable for quick MVP

### ONNX Runtime

- Professional, polished UI
- Good documentation
- Built for enterprise applications
- Strong TypeScript support

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Material-UI: Good alternative, similar features
- Chakra UI: Less comprehensive
- Tailwind CSS: Requires more custom work

### Vite

**Why:**
- Extremely fast dev server
- Fast production builds
- Native ES modules
- Better than webpack for modern projects
- Great TypeScript support

### React Query

**Why:**
- Excellent data fetching/caching
- Automatic refetching and cache invalidation
- Optimistic updates
- Better than Redux for server state
- Less boilerplate than Redux

## DevOps & Infrastructure

### Docker

**Why:**
- Consistent development environment
- Easy deployment
- Service isolation
- Industry standard
- Great for microservices

### Docker Compose

**Why:**
- Easy multi-service orchestration
- Perfect for local development
- Simple configuration
- Good for small deployments

**Production:** Will migrate to Kubernetes if needed

### pytest

**Why:**
- Most popular Python testing framework
- Excellent fixtures and parametrization
- Plugin ecosystem
- Better than unittest (more concise)

### GitHub Actions

**Why:**
- Free for public repos
- Native GitHub integration
- Simple YAML configuration
- Good for CI/CD pipelines

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Jenkins: Too complex for this project
- GitLab CI: Requires GitLab
- CircleCI: Similar to GitHub Actions

## Storage Strategy

### Phase 0-2 (MVP): Local Filesystem

**Why:**
- Simple to implement
- No additional costs
- Good for development and testing
- Easy to migrate later

### Phase 3+ (Production): MinIO or S3

**Why:**
- Scalable object storage
- CDN integration
- Versioning and backup
- Industry standard

**MinIO vs S3:**
- MinIO: Self-hosted, cheaper, S3-compatible
- S3: Managed, more reliable, higher cost

## Database Design Choices

### JSONB for Metadata

**Why:**
- Flexible schema for varying metadata
- Still queryable (unlike pure JSON)
- Good for future extensibility
- Better than separate tables for rare fields

### Array Type for Tags

**Why:**
- Native PostgreSQL support
- Efficient querying with GIN indexes
- Simpler than separate tags table
- Good performance for moderate tag counts

### Separate Images and Templates Tables

**Why:**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Templates have additional metadata
- Easy to query templates separately
- Better normalization

## Security Considerations

### Password Hashing: bcrypt

**Why:**
- Industry standard
- Built-in salt
- Adaptive (can increase cost)
- Resistant to rainbow tables

### JWT for Authentication

**Why:**
- Stateless authentication
- Works well with REST APIs
- Can include claims/permissions
- Mobile-friendly

### Environment Variables for Secrets

**Why:**
- Keeps secrets out of code
- Easy to change per environment
- Standard practice
- Works with Docker/K8s

## Performance Considerations

### Async/Await Throughout

**Why:**
- Better concurrency
- Efficient I/O operations
- Lower resource usage
- Modern Python best practice

### Background Processing with Celery

- Industry standard metrics
- Excellent visualization
- Alert capabilities
- Open source

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Datadog: Expensive
- New Relic: Expensive
- CloudWatch: AWS-specific

## Trade-offs and Future Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **Single-server Architecture**
   - Good for MVP
   - Will need load balancing later

2. **Local Storage**
   - Simple for MVP
   - Will migrate to S3/MinIO for production

3. **No CDN**
   - Not needed for MVP
   - Will add CloudFlare or similar later

### Scalability Path

1. **Phase 1-2 (MVP):** Single server
2. **Phase 3-4:** Separate API and worker servers
3. **Phase 5+:** Load balancer, multiple workers, CDN, object storage

## Conclusion

The technology stack is optimized for:
- **MVP Speed:** Fast development and iteration
- **Quality:** Production-grade face-swap results
- **Scalability:** Can grow as needed
- **Maintainability:** Popular, well-documented technologies
- **Cost:** Open source, minimal infrastructure for MVP

The choices balance:
- Rapid development vs. long-term maintainability
- Simplicity vs. scalability
- Cost vs. features
- Proven technologies vs. cutting-edge

This stack allows us to build an MVP quickly while maintaining a path to production-grade scaling.
